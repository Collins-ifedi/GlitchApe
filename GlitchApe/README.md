     source .venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
  2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set environment variables.

Notes:
- This skeleton provides apps: users, products, orders, payments, referrals, designs, api, core, account.
- You still need to add your API logic, connect Printful/Stripe/Brevo keys, and add real templates or frontend (Vue) files.
